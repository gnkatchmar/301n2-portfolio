    body:        '<p>Third assignment. Assigned problem domain:</p><img src="images/BusMall01.jpg" class="pull-right"><p>You have been hired by a startup called BusMall, whose product is similar to the SkyMall catalog found in the setback pockets on airplanes: a catalog of assorted high-markup products provided to a captive audience seeking a mental escape from the drudgery of travel. But in this case, BusMall catalogs are placed on TriMet buses... whose overall travel times from some parts of the city are now comparable to cross-country flights, after all.</p><p>Since catalogs are expensive to print and distribute, the products cost money to make and warehouse, and BusMall is a lean startup that needs to carefully watch its expenditures, BusMall wants to feature only the items in its catalog that are the most likely to sell. This means that BusMall wants to do market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interest... before actually putting them into the catalog and getting the manufacturing wheels in motion.</p><p>To make this market analysis maximally effective, BusMall wants you to build an app that displays potential products to individuals in focus groups (three products at a time), has the group members rank those three products in order of interest, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.</p><p>When the app loads, randomly select three photos from an album of photos you have been provided by the analysis team</p><p>Display the photos on the screen, side-by-side-by-side</p><p>Have some text on the screen to instruct the user to click on the product that she/he would be most likely want to buy</p><p>Use an event listener on each photo to track the number of times an individual photo has been clicked; log into the console the name of a product that has been selected, and its total votes so far. <img src="images/BusMall02.jpg" class="pull-left">At the same time, display three more random photos.</p><p>Put a "See Totals" button on the page, only after a user has voted 15 times, that displays a listing of all objects and their vote totals on the screen. The user may continue voting, but on the next vote hide the list of votes, and only display it again after 15 more votes. Stretch goal: sort the list by number of votes received before displaying it.</p><p>Even more stretch goal: calculate the percentage of votes-per-appearances for each photo and display that in a separate list.</p><p>Even MORE stretch goal: come up with another analysis metric based on the number of clicks, and present all of these data points in a table rather than a list.</p><p>You are in charge of the look-and-feel of the app too. Please do the following:</p><p>Choose a custom web font (Links to an external site.).</p><p>Create a layout using semantic HTML.</p>'

    body:        '<p>Second assignment. Assigned problem domain:</p></p><img src="images/Cookie01.jpg" class="pull-left">Your friend Pat has come up with a business idea by combining two signature Portland icons: Pat has developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. They\'re cookies made into the shape of a salmon, and actually made with salmon (though the fish is ground up so fine that you cant even taste it!) that is the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Portland morning. Or gray Portland afternoon... whatever. Tourists will go gaga for them, locals will begrudgingly fall in love with them, and Pat will make a ton of money.</p><p>But, Pat needs some help with the branding of the business, as well as some help with internal data management for the company, and has enlisted your assistance because of your extensive and proven work in developing web applications. Pat\'s Salmon Cookies, soon with franchises all over town, needs to calculate the number of cookies each location must make every day so that it can manage its supplies inventory and baking schedule. The number of cookies to make depends on the hours of operation—10:00 AM to 6:00 PM—and a few factors unique to each location:</p><p>The minimum number of customers per hour.</p><p>The maximum number of customers per hour.</p><p>The average number of cookies purchased per customer.</p><p>Because we are early in the life of this business, we will need to build an application that is adaptable. Pat will need to be able to add and remove locations from the daily projections report, and Pat will also need to be able to easily modify the input numbers for each location based on day of the week, special events, and other factors. Pat would like to see these numbers with nice formatting in a web application, and oh yeah... one more thing:</p><p><img src="images/Cookie02.jpg" class="pull-right">Pat needs you to take a leading role in doing the design work, too. Pat has a logo image picked out, but that\'s it. Yep, all you\'re getting to work off of is an illustration of a fish see Assets Folder.</p><p>Pat has asked you to come up with all other aspects of the design for the web application, including a color scheme and a custom font, and maybe additional images, and provide those in this very same web application as a style guide. So, in addition to building an application that calculates daily sales projections for each location, you also need to create a style guide that is colorful, eye-catching, readable, useful, informative, specific, repeatable, and ultimately ready for use on T-shirts, stickers, coffee mugs, cookie bags, napkins, and so on.</p><p>First, create a separate JS object for each shop location that does the following:</p><p>Stores the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties</p><p>Uses a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour.</p><p>Calculate simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour using average cookies purchased and the random number of customers generated</p><p>Store the results for each location in a separate array</p><p>Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser</p><p>Calculating the sum of these hourly totals</p><p>These numbers are simply Pat\'s estimates for now, but eventually, we\'ll want the ability to update these numbers for each location, and to add/remove locations. But we\'ll not build all of that today. Each location is its own object.</p>'

    body:        '<p>Fourth and final assignment.<img src="images/Final01.jpg" class="pull-left"></p><p>I pitched the idea of using my preexisting spreadsheet of Portland brunch locations as the basis for a class final project. It was voted "most popular" of the three projects and four other classmates (Jade Dhabolt, Rosemary Joe, Nathan Pickard, and Cheryl Cruz) joined me to make it happen.</p>First, the spreadsheet was built out, adding urls, latitude, longitude, and later, Google Place IDs. Using concatenation, the spreadsheet was then used to build the data array of 100+ restaurants (and later, a pulldown menu).</p><p><img src="images/Final02.jpg" class="pull-right">For the Home page, Jade used Google Places\' cache of restaurant-specific images to great effect where three random restaurants are displayed. He also added the option of having the user opt into geolocation, thus narrowing the restaurants displayed to those closest to the user.</p><p>For the Search page, Jade used Google Maps to display restaurants based on the user input for neighborhoods and desired time (only restuarants open at that time are displayed). Also, using the same user input, Rosemary designed the text display of same.</p><p>I designed the Review page, a "mini-Yelp" that uses local storage to somewhat mimic a database backend for the application.</p><p>Jade, with some assistance from Nathan and Cheryl, was responsible for the look and feel of the website. After some discussion, the group decided upon a "sophisticated" appearance over a "whimsical" approach which would have featured bacon-shaped buttons, bearded hipster servers, etc.</p>'
