The Restaurant Rankings page accumulates more than five years worth of (mostly positive) dining experiences. The Cocktails Guide pages features three interesting infographics. The Portland Dining Guide is simply a multi-tabbed Google Sheet in an iframe. The About page is self-explanatory with links to my Treehouse Achievement Badges and my resume on LinkedIn.<p>'

It was voted "most popular" of the three projects and four other classmates (Jade Dhabolt, Rosemary Joe, Nathan Pickard, and Cheryl Cruz) joined me to make it happen.</p>First, the spreadsheet was built out, adding urls, latitude, longitude, and later, Google Place IDs. Using concatenation, the spreadsheet was then used to build the data array of 100+ restaurants (and later, a pulldown menu).</p><p><img src="images/Final02.jpg" class="pull-right">For the Home page, Jade used Google Places\' cache of restaurant-specific images to great effect where three random restaurants are displayed. He also added the option of having the user opt into geolocation, thus narrowing the restaurants displayed to those closest to the user.</p><p>For the Search page, Jade used Google Maps to display restaurants based on the user input for neighborhoods and desired time (only restuarants open at that time are displayed). Also, using the same user input, Rosemary designed the text display of same.</p><p>I designed the Review page, a "mini-Yelp" that uses local storage to somewhat mimic a database backend for the application.</p><p>Jade, with some assistance from Nathan and Cheryl, was responsible for the look and feel of the website. After some discussion, the group decided upon a "sophisticated" appearance over a "whimsical" approach which would have featured bacon-shaped buttons, bearded hipster servers, etc.</p>'
